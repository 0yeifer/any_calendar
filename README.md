# Any Calendar

> [!WARNING]
> üöß This application is currently in development, ‚ö†Ô∏è it is not ready for production ‚ö†Ô∏è. üöß

The current implementation of this application is very rudimentary. This was designed to integrate two calendar providers (Go High Level and HubSpot) with the standard behavior of syncing events across Google calendars in frappe. I'm working on a more professional implementation üßó. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please don't use this in production ‚ö†Ô∏è, as it probably won't fit your business needs.

However, this is a work in progress, and I'll be working to make it much better.

Each doctype for this application have been named with the prefix "ANYCAL" (short for "Any Calendar"). This is to avoid conflicts with other applications that may have similar doctypes.
