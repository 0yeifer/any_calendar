## Any Calendar

> [!WARNING]
> 🚧 This application is currently in development, ⚠️ it is not ready for production ⚠️. 🚧

The current imp+lementation of this application is very rudimentary. This was designed to integrate two calendar providers (Go High Level and HubSpot) with the standard behavior of syncing events across calendars. I'm working on a more professional implementation 🧗. ⚠️ Please don't use this in production ⚠️, as it probably won't fit your business needs.

However, this is a work in progress, and I'll be working to make it much better.
